# Movie Rental Project

## Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing 
stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth 
management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental 
service in order to stay competitive


## Objective:
The goal of this project is to launch the new online video rental service while answering the following key business questions:

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?  
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?  
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?   
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?   
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

## Data
The data set contains information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The data set will need to be loaded into the PostgreSQL database while keeping the following points in mind:

● It's around 3MB and contains several files  
● A relationship exists between two tables if a column name is present in both tables
